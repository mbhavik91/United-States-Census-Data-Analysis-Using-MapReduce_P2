My first MapReduce provides output to first 6 Questions. For Question 7 and 8 it will generate the output.
For the last two question it will make use of the first MapReduce's output and will again run MapReduce to generate the actual output.

Input:
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar workspace/CS455Part2/dist/part2.jar cs455.hadoop.part2.MyMain /data/census /home/myOutput

Then you need to check "myOutput" directory for questions 1-6.
For Questions 7-8, new directory will be generated known as "mOutput_lastTwoQuestions".

I have created custom data type to read the data in only one pass.

I have checked, my program works correctly and generates output correctly.

My main class name is MyMain. My jar file name is part2.jar.

Thanks,
Bhavik Mistry.
